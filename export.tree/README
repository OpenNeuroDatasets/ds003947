Resting EEG and MEG data was gathered for two independently collected samples of healthy and First Episode Psychosis (FEP) individuals.
To obtain resting data, EEG channels were recorded for 5 minutes using an Elekta Neuromag Vectorview system.
EEG was recorded using a low-impedance 10-10 system 60-channel cap. 
The second collected sample of EEG data is provided here. This sample excludes a portion of subjects that have been included with the first acquisition (EEG: First Episode Psychosis vs. Control Resting Task 1), since they were collected using the same montage.
The subjects that have been excluded here and are included in Task 1 are: sub-2140A, sub-2170A, sub-2174A, sub-2176A, sub-2177A, sub-2184A, sub-2193A, sub-2214A, sub-2217A, sub-2221A.

The phenotype directory contains clinical assessment results and data divided by type for all subjects. The assessment results were categorized as follows:
BPRS - Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale,
SANS - Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms,
SAPS - Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms,
GAFGAS - Global Assessment of Functioning,
SFS - Social Functioning Scale,
MATRICS - MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery,
WASI - Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, 
Hollingshead - Hollingshead Four-Factor Index of Socioeconomic Status,
Medications - Chlorpromazine equivalency of prescribed medication at time of EEG scan.
Values/scores that were not collected and questions without given responses are denoted by n/a.
