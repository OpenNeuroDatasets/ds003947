Resting EEG and MEG data was gathered for two independently collected samples of healthy and First Episode Psychosis (FEP) individuals.
To obtain resting data, EEG channels were recorded for 5 minutes using an Elekta Neuromag Vectorview system.
EEG was recorded using a low-impedance 10-10 system 60-channel cap. 
The second collected sample of EEG data is provided here. This sample excludes a portion of subjects that have been included with the first acquisition (EEG: First Episode Psychosis vs. Control Resting Task 1), since they were collected using the same montage.
The subjects that have been excluded here and are included in Task 1 are: sub-2140A, sub-2170A, sub-2174A, sub-2176A, sub-2177A, sub-2184A, sub-2193A, sub-2214A, sub-2217A, sub-2221A.
